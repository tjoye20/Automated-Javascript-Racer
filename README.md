# Automated JavaScript Racer Game 
JavaScript racer game that's automatically plays itself when the user presses any key on there keyboard.

### Project Goal

I was challenged to build a JavaScript racer game for two players, using the keyup event, but I didn't want people banging on my keyboard, so I decided to create an automated version.

The ultimate goal is to finish the OOJS refator in the ```` refactor.js ```` file, so the game is object-oriented. But for now, the original design works just fine, and that's what loads when the user launches the game.

### Quickstart

After cloning the repository onto your local machine, just ```` open index.html ```` to launch the game in your browser. Press any key on your keyboard and the game will automatically play it self.
